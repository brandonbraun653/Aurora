Aurora: Goddess of the Dawn [*of my engineering projects...*]

This repository is a baseline from which all my other projects will eventually be built on top of. It is a combination of [Chimera](https://github.com/brandonbraun653/Chimera)
and helper libraries that build out a lot of core functionalities needed in an embedded system. While Chimera is intenteded to
provide high level interfaces with common HW peripherals, Aurora builds on that to both extend existing functionality and create entirely
new features that don't necessarily fit in Chimera.
